<!-- INTRO -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#F5F5F5" data-theme="light">
  <p class="case-intro">
    Large healthcare organizations rely on accurate workforce data to ensure proper
    compensation, compliance, and operational efficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project focused on improving a critical internal platform used by healthcare
    professionals to report working hours, which directly impacts payroll calculations,
    hospital budgeting, and workforce planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to confidentiality constraints, this case study focuses on process, decisions,
    and outcomes rather than final UI visuals.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Context</h2>

  <p>
    The platform supports healthcare systems by centralizing workforce operations,
    including provider management, compliance, and time tracking.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of its core workflows allows doctors to log worked hours across highly variable
    schedules, often involving different roles, locations, and approval states.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CHALLENGE -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>The Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    Time tracking in healthcare is uniquely complex. Physicians do not follow fixed
    schedules, and errors in reporting can directly affect compensation and operational
    decisions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Highly complex, data-dense tables with multiple states and time categories</li>
    <li>High cognitive load for users operating under time pressure</li>
    <li>Risk of errors impacting payroll accuracy and hospital budgets</li>
    <li>Strict business and data constraints typical of enterprise healthcare systems</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    How might we reduce cognitive overload and error risk in a critical,
    high-stakes time reporting workflow?
  </blockquote>
</section>

<!-- ROLE -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#000000" data-theme="dark">
  <h2>My Role</h2>

  <p>
    I worked as a <strong>Product / UX Designer</strong>, focusing on improving usability,
    clarity, and accessibility within an existing enterprise system.
  </p>

  <p>
    My scope centered on analyzing and redesigning a complex table-based workflow used
    by healthcare professionals to log, review, and validate worked hours.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- UX APPROACH -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>UX Approach</h2>

  <p>
    Given the constraints of an enterprise environment, the approach prioritized
    incremental improvements with high impact.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Audited existing workflows to identify friction and error-prone interactions</li>
    <li>Analyzed information hierarchy within dense tables</li>
    <li>Reviewed accessibility gaps against WCAG standards</li>
    <li>Worked closely with product and engineering to validate feasibility</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN DECISIONS -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>

  <ul class="insights-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Progressive disclosure:</strong> Reduced cognitive load by surfacing
      summaries first, with detailed data available on demand.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Visual grouping:</strong> Improved scanability of tables through clearer
      grouping, spacing, and hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Error prevention:</strong> Clarified editable vs locked states to reduce
      accidental input errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility-first:</strong> Ensured contrast, focus states, and keyboard
      navigation supported diverse user needs.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- OUTCOME -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#F5F5F5" data-theme="light">
  <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>

  <p>
    The redesigned time tracking experience enabled healthcare organizations to accurately register working hours across multiple hospitals while reducing manual errors and operational friction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system supported complex calculations related to shifts, variable schedules, and compensation, while remaining compliant with accessibility standards and internal workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    By improving clarity and structure within a highly constrained environment, the platform became easier to operate for both medical staff and administrative teams.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- WHY IT WAS COMPLEX -->
<section class="case-section">
    <h2>Why it was complex</h2>
  <p>This was not a simple data entry table.</p>
    <p>The experience needed to support:</p>

  <ul class="insights-list">
    <li>
      Multiple hospitals operating under different rules
    </li>
    <li>  
    Integration with check-in and check-out systems
    </li>
    <li>
Automatic hour calculations and validations
    </li>
    <li>
Data consistency for billing and payroll processes
    </li>
    <li>
Accessibility requirements for a wide range of users
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>Each design decision had downstream impact on finance, operations, and compliance, making precision and clarity critical.</p>
</section>

<!-- CONSTRAINTS -->
<section class="case-section case-reflection">
  <h2>Working within constraints</h2>

  <p>
    The product relied on an existing design system and legacy technical constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    My role focused on translating operational and business requirements into a usable interface without increasing cognitive load for users who interacted with the system daily.
  </p>

    <p>
    This required close collaboration with product, engineering, and operational stakeholders to ensure the solution was both usable and technically viable.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- REFLECTION -->
<section class="case-section case-reflection">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Designing complex operational tools reinforced the importance of clarity over aesthetics.
  </p>

  <p>
    In healthcare environments, good UX is not about delight.
    It is about trust, accuracy, and reducing the risk of human error.
  </p>

    <p>
    This project strengthened my ability to design for systems where usability directly impacts financial and operational outcomes.
