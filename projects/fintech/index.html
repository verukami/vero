<section class="case-section">
  <p class="case-intro">
    This project was developed within a large-scale digital banking platform used by
    multiple financial institutions across different markets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core product, design system, and base application flows already existed for both
    desktop and mobile experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    The challenge was not to redesign from scratch, but to adapt complex financial flows
    to specific business, regulatory, and user needs without compromising scalability
    or consistency.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>The challenge</h2>

  <p>
    While the platform provided robust banking functionality, real-world implementations
    required adjustments to align with each institution’s operational model.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many existing flows needed refinement to support local requirements while remaining
    aligned with the core product architecture.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    How can enterprise banking flows be customized to local needs without fragmenting
    the product or increasing long-term complexity?
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section class="case-section" data-bg="#000000" data-theme="dark">
  <h2>Users and context</h2>

  <p>
    The end users varied depending on the market and type of banking product, but shared
    a common expectation of clarity, reliability, and efficiency.
  </p>

  <ul class="insights-list">
    <li>
      End users performing frequent financial operations
    </li>
    <li>
      Internal banking teams managing and configuring products
    </li>
    <li>
      Stakeholders operating under strict regulatory constraints
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    In enterprise banking, predictability matters more than novelty.
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>UX approach</h2>

  <p>
    The UX approach focused on identifying friction within existing flows and proposing
    improvements that balanced usability, technical feasibility, and business rules.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing existing desktop and mobile flows</li>
    <li>Collaborating with banking stakeholders to understand local needs</li>
    <li>Designing solutions within the constraints of the existing design system</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every proposal required alignment across design, product, engineering, and business.
  </p>

    <p>
      The platform supported both B2C and B2B banking flows, requiring different levels of complexity, permissions, and operational logic.
    </p>
  </section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Working within a design system</h2>

  <p>
    The platform relied on an established design system shared across multiple markets.
  </p>

  <p>
    My role involved determining when existing components could be reused and when
    extensions were necessary to support new requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    All adaptations were documented to ensure future scalability and consistency.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Cross-functional collaboration</h2>

  <p>
    The team included a product manager, business analyst, engineering lead, designer,
    and additional technical stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked closely with both internal teams and banking representatives to validate
    assumptions, align on constraints, and ensure design decisions were feasible and
    clearly communicated.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Outcome</h2>

  <p>
    The resulting solutions enabled banks to adapt critical flows to their needs without
    deviating from the core platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach reduced implementation friction while maintaining a consistent user
    experience across markets.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="case-section case-reflection">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Designing for enterprise banking reinforced the importance of working within
    constraints rather than around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The value was not in visual novelty, but in making complex systems clearer,
    more adaptable, and easier to operate.
