<!-- INTRO -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#F8E0F2" data-theme="light">
  <p>
    Purchasing high-value fashion online comes with a specific type of friction:
    uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    For customers buying premium Indian garments that are rich in texture, embroidery,
    and cultural detail. Traditional e-commerce fails to communicate fit,
    drape, and presence.
  </p>

  <p class="case-intro">
    Melifloz was created to bridge that gap.
  </p>

  <p>
    A high-fidelity spatial commerce ecosystem designed to help users make confident,
  informed purchase decisions when buying high-value Indian garments online.
  </p>
</section>


<!-- CHALLENGE -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#f8e0f2" data-theme="light">
  <h2>The Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    Traditional fashion e-commerce relies heavily on static imagery and size charts,
    which are insufficient for garments with complex silhouettes and materials.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>High return rates due to poor fit expectations</li>
    <li>Low confidence when purchasing premium-priced items</li>
    <li>Limited emotional connection to the product</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    How might we help users visualize how high-value garments will look and feel on
    their own bodies — before committing to a purchase?
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Platform Context</h2>

  <p>
    The experience was designed within the constraints of a modular e-commerce
    platform, where performance, scalability, and conversion are as critical
    as visual expression.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Component-based layouts adaptable to different product categories</li>
    <li>Reusable UI patterns aligned with theme limitations</li>
    <li>Clear separation between content, interaction, and commerce logic</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    The goal was elevating modular commerce throught sensory-driven interactions.
  </blockquote>
</section>


<!-- USERS -->
<section class="case-section" data-bg="#000000" data-theme="dark">
  <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>

  <p>
    Research and behavioral analysis revealed three core user segments:
  </p>

  <ul class="insights-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion-conscious buyers</strong> looking for premium, culturally rich
      garments and willing to invest when confident in the fit
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Occasion-driven shoppers</strong> purchasing outfits for weddings,
      celebrations, or special events
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Remote customers</strong> without access to physical boutiques
    </li>
  </ul>

    <div class="image-block">
    <img src="../melifloz/assets/images/userpersona.png" alt="User Persona for Melifloz">
    <span class="caption">
      Priya represents our core segment: High-value, time-poor professionals whose main barrier to purchase is fit uncertainty.
    </span>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    Confidence, not discounts, was the main conversion driver.
  </blockquote>
</section>





<!-- UX STRATEGY -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>UX Strategy</h2>

  <p>
  The strategy was all about <strong>Product-Market Fit</strong>. I wanted to build more than just another fashion app; I wanted to create something that actually helps a startup stand out from giants like Amazon or Farfetch.
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Scalable Design:</strong> I built a modular component system so the platform can grow quickly without breaking.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive Edge:</strong> Using "Spatial Fitting" helps users feel the actual garment, reducing hesitation before they buy.</li>
  <li><strong>Investor-Ready:</strong> The final design was a key asset to show investors that the technology is viable and solves a real problem.</li>
  </ul>

</section>


<!-- VIRUTAL TRY ON -->
<section class="case-section">
  <h2>Fit Confidence Layer</h2>

    <p>
    Instead of making the body scan a standalone feature, we integrated it directly into the shopping flow. The goal is simple: let users see how the fabric drapes and fits their actual measurements so they can buy with total confidence.
    </p>

  <div class="image-grid">
    <img src="../melifloz/assets/images/scan_fit.png" alt="fit scan process">
        <span class="caption">
      Phase 1: Precision Mapping. Utilizing spatial computing to analyze body proportions in real-time, eliminating the sizing guesswork that frustrates petite users.
    </span>
    <img src="../melifloz/assets/images/outfit-scan.png" alt="outfit scan process">
        <span class="caption">
      Phase 2: The Digital Drape. An AI-driven overlay that simulates how luxury fabrics move and sit on the user's unique silhouette, providing immediate fit confidence.
    </span>
  </div>


</section>

  <section class="case-section">
  <h2>Vision and Fundraising</h2>

  <p>
    Since this was a startup looking for investment, success was about how the design helped tell the business story. The design proved three key points:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fewer Returns:</strong> By seeing the real fit beforehand, users are much less likely to return items.</li>
    <li><strong>Luxury Confidence:</strong> It is easier to buy high-value items when you can actually visualize them on your own body.</li>
    <li><strong>Real Innovation:</strong> We showed that we could use advanced tech to solve a massive problem in the fashion industry.</li>
  </ul>

    <div class="image-block">
    <img src="../melifloz/assets/images/product-detail.png" alt="Screenshot of Melifloz product detail page">
    <span class="caption">
      The Conversion Bridge. By pairing immersive detail with accurate spatial fitting, we solve the two biggest hurdles for luxury shoppers: quality verification and sizing accuracy.
    </span>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    Design wasn't just about looks; it was the main tool to turn a visionary idea into a fundable reality.
  </blockquote>


</section>


<!-- REFLECTION -->
<section class="case-section case-reflection">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Melifloz taught me that for a startup, design is about taking the "risk" out of the future. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal was to show that technology can be human and help luxury shopping feel as personal and secure as being in a physical boutique.
