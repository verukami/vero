<!-- INTRO -->
 <section class="case-section" data-bg="#F8E0F2" data-theme="light"> 
  <p>
      People don’t experience life in clean phases: they move through emotional transitions.
      New cities. Broken routines. Shifting relationships. Quiet moments of recalibration.<br><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    During those moments, the digital tools meant to support emotional well-being often do the opposite: they fragment attention, over-categorize feelings, and turn reflection into another task to manage.
  <br><br>
  </p>

  <p class="case-intro">
    Alienpooh started as a response to that tension.<br><br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A personal exploration into how digital spaces, could support emotional awareness and meaningful connection, without noise,
    pressure, or performative vulnerability.

<!-- Role & Scope -->
<section class="project-meta" data-bg="#F8F9f9" data-theme="light">
  <div class="meta-block">
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
      I led Alienpooh end-to-end as a Product Designer, owning the experience from early research to final UI execution.<br><br>
      This included:<br><br>
      • Defining the emotional and interantion principles.<br><br>
      • Translating abstract emotional needs into concrete product decisions.<br><br>
      • Designing a sclable system rather than a single flow.<br><br>
      Alienpooh is not a feature concept, it is a product hypothesis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="meta-block">
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>The scope focused on depth rather than breadth.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User research & synthesis  </li><br>
      <li>UX strategy & AI</li><br>
      <li>Wireframing & Prototyping</li><br>
      <li>High-fidelity UI</li><br>
      <li>Design system foundations for scalability</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Every decision prioritized emotional clarity over feature density.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- CHALLENGE -->
  <section class="case-section" data-bg="#f8e0f2" data-theme="light">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      Emotional tracking, journaling, and social connection often live in separate tools.
      Switching between them creates cognitive and emotional fatigue.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      How might we design a single, intuitive space that supports emotional awareness,
      expression, and connection, without overwhelming the user?
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <!-- USER INSIGHTS -->
  <section class="case-section" data-bg="#000000" data-theme="dark">
    <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>

    <div class="image-block">
      <img src="../alienpooh/assets/images/user-insights.png" alt="Empathy mapping and insights">
      <span class="caption">Behavioral patterns and emotional needs synthesis</span>
        <p class="insight-highlight">
  Research revealed a consistent pattern: <br>
  Users weren't asking for more emotional tools, they were asking for less noise.<br><br>
  Across interviews and synthesis, three needs surfaced clearly:
</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="insights-list">
      <li>Emotional reflection needed to feel private, calm, and non-judgmental</li>
      <li>Connection felt meaninful only when it was intentional, not algorithmic</li>
      <li>Simplicity increased trust more than customization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The most important insight wasn't behavioral, it was emotional.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Users needed a space that felt safe enough to be unfinished.
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Vision & Design Principles</h2>

    <p>
      Alienpooh was designed as a flexible emotional space that adapts to different life
      rhythms and personal needs.<br><br>
      Three principles guided every design decision:
    </p>

    <ul class="principles">
      <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> Reduce cognitive load<br> If an interaction required explanation, it was redesigned.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional clarity</strong> Visual language and interaction neeeded to feel calm, and emotionally neutral.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> The product adapts to the user's life rhythms instead of asking the user to adapt to the product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These principles acted as constraints, nos aspirations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WIREFRAMES -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Wireframes & Early Exploration</h2>

    <p>
      Early wireframes focused less on layout and more on emotional pacing.<br><br>
      During testing, users consistently paused before saving entries or gaging with others.<br><br>
      Rather than interpreting this as friction, it was treated as a signal: <br><br>
    </p>
    <div class="image-block">
      <img src="../alienpooh/assets/images/wireframe.png" alt="Empathy mapping and insights">
      <span class="caption">Structural wireframe exploring intentional interaction over content consumption.<br>
        The layout removes default feeds in favor of emotionally driven actions, reinforcing calm, agency, and non-performative use.
      </span>
    </div>

    <p>
      That hesitation informed: <br><br>
      • Softer transitions.<br><br>
      • Fewer decisions points<br><br>
      • Intentional pauses within flows<br><br>
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTERACTIONS -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Interaction Design</h2>

    <div class="image-block">
      <img src="../alienpooh/assets/images/flow-a.gif" alt="Interaction prototype">
      <span class="caption">Rather than immediately pushing users into content, this flow introduces a deliberate pause.<br>

Relax the mind begins with an empty state that allows users to slow down before choosing an activity, reframing relaxation as a state of being, not a task to complete.</span>
      <p>
      Micro-interactions avoided gamification or feedback that could imply emotional "progress" or judgment.
      Animations were subtle, slow and optional.<br><br>
      The product needed to feel like a space users could reutn to not something that demanded engagement.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Emotional design here was about restraint, not expressiveness.
    </blockquote>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- FINAL UI -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Design Execution</h2>

    <div class="image-grid">
      <img src="images/final-ui-1.jpg" alt="Final UI screen">
      <img src="images/final-ui-2.jpg" alt="Final UI screen">
    </div>

    <p>
      The final UI balances emotional warmth with functional clarity,
      supported by a scalable design system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OUTCOME -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      Alienpooh resulted in a unified emotional experience that: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unified emotional reflection and connection into a single space</li>
      <li>Reduced cognitive and emotional load</li>
      <li>Calm, emotionally supportive experience</li>
      <li>Scalable system for future growth</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
      The outcome is not a finished product, it is a validated direction.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- REFLECTION -->
  <section class="case-section case-reflection">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      Designing Alienpooh reinforced that strong products are not only usable, 
      they are emotionally aware. <br><br>
      Emotional well-being tools don't need to motivate, optimize, or quantify feelings. 
      Sometimes, the most meaningful design decisions is to step back and allow space.<br><br>
      Alienpooh exists as a reminder that design can support humans, without trying to fix them.
